RAM stands for Random Accessed Memory.
It is needed for your computer system to function. Increasing your RAM doesn't improve the overall performance of your computer system. I would recommend that you have 4GB RAM per CPU core. 
(4 CPU cores (Quad core) would mean that you should have a minimum of 16GB of RAM).
